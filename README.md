# Format
Given a text of reasonable size as an input, where each word is at most 20 characters and is not cut between two lines, the code formats it such that:
1. The character size of each line (except the last one) is 60.
2. Each line (except the last one) spreads from one end to the other
3. The spaces between words in each line are as close to each other as possible and differ by at most 1 in length. For instance, 2 2 3 3 are acceptable space lengths, but 1 2 3 4 are not. 
4. The spaces are increasing (not necessarily strictly) from left to right.

The output is then transferred to another file.
